Problem Description

To reduce printing waste, a school is implementing PaperCut and will charge for printing as follows:

Paper size A4, job type single sided:

 * 15 cents per black and white page

 * 25 cents per colour page

Paper size A4, job type double-sided:

 * 10 cents per black and white page

 * 20 cents per colour page

Write a program in Java (or if we have discussed it during our phone conversation  - another programming language you feel more comfortable with) that helps the system administrator to calculate the print costs. It takes a list of A4 print jobs and calculates the cost of each job, given the total number of pages, number of colour pages and whether printing is double-sided.

Support for other paper sizes will be added in the future.    

The application should:

 * Read print jobs from a file (see attached file for an example.)

 * Output the job details and job cost for each job to the console

 * Output the total cost of all jobs to the console
